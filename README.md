# DownscalingSEA
Code which accompanies the paper:
Super Image Resolution techniques for Downscaling in South East Asia (url:)

The models are designed to run in Google Colab. All the code is provided needed to build, train, run a Autoencoder to downscale a single variable for South East Asia, but can be modified for any geographical area. 

It is recommended that climate is data is downloaded to your google drive via the API or the online forms on the Copernicus climate data store (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/projections-cmip5-daily-single-levels?tab=overview)

Alternatively, the data used to generate the models and outputs in this paper can be downloaded here:
